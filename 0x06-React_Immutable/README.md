## Title Description
This project aims to delve into the realm of immutable data structures within React applications, employing the Immutable.js library. Throughout this endeavor, participants will grasp the concept of immutable objects and their significance. The primary focus lies in harnessing Immutable.js to enforce immutability in JavaScript, fostering a deeper understanding of its utilities such as converting objects into immutable maps, accessing nested elements, working with lists, merging data, and ensuring equality checks. Additionally, the project explores the optimization potential offered by lazy Seq.



## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- A mandatory README.md file, located at the root of the project folder
- All scripts should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using node 12.x.x and npm 6.x.x
- All files should end with a new line
- All functions must be exported

## Task Description
### 0. Converting into an Immutable object using fromJS
Convert a given object into an immutable Map using Immutable.js library's `fromJS` function.

### 1. Converting into Immutable using Map
Modify the function to use `Map` from Immutable.js.

### 2. Accessing nested elements
Edit a function to return the value of an object at a defined path.

### 3. List and push
Create functions to convert an array into an immutable List and add elements to the List.

### 4. Chained mutations
Create Immutable Maps and perform chained mutations.

### 5. Merge & concat
Implement functions to merge and concatenate elements using Immutable.js Lists and Maps.

### 6. Nested merge
Create a function to deeply merge two objects into a List.

### 7. Equality
Develop a function to check equality between two Immutable.js Maps.

### 8. Lazy Seq
Implement a function to filter and print best students based on given grades.
